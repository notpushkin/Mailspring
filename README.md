**Mailspring Libre is a project aiming at creating a [Mailspring](https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring) build without its telemetry services.** It replaces the JavaScript sync code in Nylas Mail with a new C++ sync engine based on [Mailcore2](https://github.com/MailCore/mailcore2). It uses roughly half the RAM and CPU of Nylas Mail and idles with almost zero "CPU Wakes", which translates to great battery life. It also has an entirely revamped composer and other great new features.

Mailspring Libre's UI is open source (GPLv3) and written in TypeScript with [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron) and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) - it's built on a plugin architecture and was designed to be easy to extend. Check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/notpushkin/Mailspring-Libre/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started!

Mailspring Libre's sync engine is spawned by the Electron application and runs locally on your computer. It will be open-sourced in the future but is [currently closed source.](https://github.com/notpushkin/Mailspring-Libre/blob/master/ROADMAP.md#why-is-mailsync-closed-source) When you set up your development environment, Mailspring Libre uses the latest version of the sync process we've shipped for your platform so you don't need to pull sources or install its compile-time dependencies.

## Features

Mailspring Libre comes packed with powerful features like Unified Inbox, Snooze, Send Later, Mail Rules, Templates and more. **All of these features run in the client - Mailspring does not send your email credentials to the cloud.** There's no monthly subscription or tracking.

## Building Mailspring Libre

You can find details on [how to build and run Mailspring Libre in the contributing documentation](https://github.com/notpushkin/Mailspring-Libre/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#build-and-run-from-source)

## Download Mailspring Libre

You can download compiled versions of Mailspring Libre for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux (deb, rpm and snap) from [the releases section](https://github.com/notpushkin/Mailspring-Libre/releases).

## Contributing

Mailspring Libre's UI is entirely open-source and pull requests and contributions are welcome! There are three ways to contribute: building a plugin, building a theme, and submitting pull requests to the project itself.

### Building A Plugin

Plugins lie at the heart of Mailspring Libre and give it its powerful features. Building your own plugins allows you to integrate the app with other tools, experiment with new workflows, and more. Follow the [Getting Started guide](https://Foundry376.github.io/Mailspring/) to write your first plugin in five minutes.

### Building a Theme

The Mailspring Libre user interface is styled using CSS, which means it's easy to modify and extend. Mailspring Libre comes stock with a few beautiful themes, and there are many more which have been built by community developers. To start creating a theme, [clone the theme starter](https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring-Theme-Starter)!

If you are updating an existing Nylas theme for Mailspring Libre here is a [step by step tutorial](https://foundry376.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001918391-How-do-I-update-an-N1-Nylas-Mail-theme-for-Mailspring-). Notice: as part of the update process you will probably need to [import Mailspring Libre base variables](https://github.com/notpushkin/Mailspring-Libre/issues/326#issuecomment-343757775).

### Localizing / Translating

Mailspring Libre 1.5.0 and above support localization. If you're a fluent speaker of another language, we'd love your help improving translations. Check out the [LOCALIZATION](https://github.com/notpushkin/Mailspring-Libre/blob/master/LOCALIZATION.md) guide for more information.

### Contributing to Mailspring Core

Pull requests are always welcome - check out [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/notpushkin/Mailspring-Libre/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information about setting up the development environment, running tests locally, and submitting pull requests.
